# inception
Learn about Docker orchestration tools like Docker Compose, which help to manage multi-container applications.

In the **Inception project**, we are tasked with setting up and managing our own infrastructure using containerization technology, specifically **Docker**. The project’s goal is to introduce us to concepts of system administration, server setup, and virtualization, which are essential for backend development and DevOps. Here’s an outline of what the project typically involves:

### Objectives of the Inception Project
1. **Learn about Containers**: 
   - Use **Docker** to containerize applications and services.
   - Understand the fundamentals of containerization, isolation, and scaling.
   
2. **Build a Multi-Service Architecture**:
   - Set up multiple services (e.g., **Nginx**, **MariaDB**, **WordPress**) and ensure they work together, communicating through their respective containers.
   - Set up reverse proxying using **Nginx**.
   
3. **Manage Databases**:
   - Set up and manage a **MariaDB** database that interacts with a web server.

4. **Automation & Scalability**:
   - Learn about Docker orchestration tools like **Docker Compose**, which help to manage multi-container applications.
   - Create a setup that is both scalable and efficient.

### Core Concepts Introduced in the Project:
- **Docker**: Students use Docker to isolate environments and services, learning how to containerize applications.
- **Nginx**: Used as a web server and reverse proxy, introducing us to networking and server setup.
- **MariaDB/MySQL**: Setting up and interacting with databases.
- **WordPress**: Running a simple content management system on top of the infrastructure, giving insight into deploying web applications.

The Inception project teaches how to manage infrastructure in a modern way and provides a solid foundation for deeper system administration tasks and cloud computing. It’s often one of the first exposure points to the world of backend infrastructure and DevOps at 42.
